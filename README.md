# jTwitterAPI example

This is a simple example of a main class consuming Twitter API thanks to the project jTwitterAPI: [https://github.com/thepocagency/com.tpa.opensource.twitterapi](https://github.com/thepocagency/com.tpa.opensource.twitterapi).

Check the main class ofr more information:
Step 1. User has to log in the Twitter API
Step 2. It calls the Twitter streaming API (using class StreamingSearch.java)
Steps 3. + 4. 
 - It orders the messages grouped by user (users sorted chronologically, ascending) 
 - The messages per user are also sorted chronologically, ascending
 - Print this information to the command line + in a log file (cf. /log/twitter.log)


If you follow the next compilation process, you will obtain a standalone JAR file.

This project contains couple of generic classes to create new Twitter calls quickly and easily. There is also an example of how to use Twitter streaming calls.

## How to use it / Example

1. Go to your workspace directory

2. Clone the jTwitterAPI from this URL: [https://github.com/thepocagency/com.tpa.opensource.twitterapi](https://github.com/thepocagency/com.tpa.opensource.twitterapi)

    2.a. Change configuration properties in the file config.properties, 
    you specially have to set the ```twitter.consumerKey``` and ```twitter.consumerSecret``` properties

NB: if you want to have results in different log files, you can change the ```java.util.logging.everyLogInSameFile``` property in the config.properties

NB: you can also see that we specially develop a light formatter to read Twitter messages more easily in the log file(s)


    2.b. Compile this project with Maven: ```mvn clean install```

3. Clone this second project from: [https://github.com/thepocagency/com.tpa.opensource.twitterapi.examples](https://github.com/thepocagency/com.tpa.opensource.twitterapi.examples)

    3.b. Compile this second project with Maven: ```mvn clean compile assembly:single```

    3.c. Run the project ```java -jar target/com.tpa.opensource.twitterapi.examples-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar```

4. Results will be printed in the console and in a the log file: log/twitter.log


## Visible results

We've created a very simple Formatter to print lighted log messages, so in log/twitter.log, you can find result:
